## Project Overview

ClinicEase aims to simplify day-to-day administrative tasks for clinics. The project provides a foundation for managing patients, appointments, doctors, prescriptions, and simple reports. It is suitable for learning full-stack development or as a starter template for building a production-ready clinic management system.

## Features

* Patient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Appointment scheduling and management
* Doctor/Provider profiles
* Prescription creation and history
* Basic reporting (appointments per day, patient counts)
* Authentication and role-based access (Admin, Receptionist, Doctor)
* Input validation and error handling

## Tech Stack

> *Adjust the stack below to match the code in the repository if different*

* Backend: Node.js + Express / or Python Flask / Django (replace based on repo)
* Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite
* ORM: Sequelize / TypeORM / SQLAlchemy (if any)
* Frontend: React / Vue / Server-side rendered templates
* Authentication: JWT / Session-based
* Styling: Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 16 (if Node backend) or Python >= 3.9 (if Python backend)
* npm or yarn (for Node) / pip (for Python)
* PostgreSQL or MySQL (or SQLite for local dev)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kapilcyber/ClinicEase.git
cd ClinicEase
```

2. Install backend dependencies (example for Node):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies (if present):

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder (copy `.env.example` if provided) and set the following:

```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/clinicease
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

Adjust keys according to your stack.

### Database Setup & Migrations

* Create the database in your DBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL).
* Run migrations / ORM sync command. Example with Sequelize:

```bash
npx sequelize db:migrate
npx sequelize db:seed:all   # optional: seed sample data
```

If using Django:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json  # optional
```

### Running the Application

**Backend (Node example):**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev     # starts dev server (nodemon)
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port).

## Usage

### Authentication

The app supports role-based access. Create an initial admin user either through an `seed` script or via a registration endpoint (if enabled). Use JWT tokens or session cookies to authenticate API requests.

### Core Modules

* **Patients:** Add new patients, view medical history, update demographics.
* **Appointments:** Book, reschedule, cancel appointments. Calendar view recommended.
* **Doctors:** Manage doctor profiles and available time slots.
* **Prescriptions:** Create prescriptions linked to appointments and patients.
* **Reports:** Generate simple reports for appointments, patient counts, and revenue (if billing is added).

### API Endpoints (example)

> Replace these examples with the actual endpoints from your code.

```
POST /api/auth/login           # Login and receive token
POST /api/patients             # Create patient
GET  /api/patients/:id         # Get patient by id
PUT  /api/patients/:id         # Update patient
DELETE /api/patients/:id       # Delete patient
GET  /api/appointments         # List appointments
POST /api/appointments        # Create appointment
```

## Testing

Run backend tests (example):

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Write unit tests for critical modules: authentication, appointment booking, and patient CRUD.

## Deployment

* Use environment variables to store secrets and connection strings.
* Containerize with Docker for consistent environments.
* Example Docker commands (generic):

```bash
docker build -t clinicease/backend ./backend
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file backend/.env clinicease/backend
```

* Consider hosting: Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or a VPS.
